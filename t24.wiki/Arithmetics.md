# Arithmetic Operations

Arithmetic operations are done using the following operators:

* Addition: `+`
* Subtraction: `-`
* Multiplication: `*`
* Division: `/`
* Exponent (Power): `**` or `^`

The precedences are the same as in any other programming language: `*` and `/` have higher precedence than `+` and `-`.
You can use `( )` to override them.

```basic
x = 2 + 3 * 4           ;* x = 14
// But
y = (2 + 3) * 4         ;* y = 20

```
