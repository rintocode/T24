# Assignment and Comparison Operators

## Assignment Operator and expressions

* **=** is used for assigning values to variables: eg `age = 30` 

* **op=** is called assignment operator, where `op` is one of `+ - * /` i.e  
 `+= -= *= /=`
 * `age += 1` is equivalent to `age = age + 1`
 * _use these assignment operators when dealing with numbers_

## Comparison Operators

* `EQ` or `=`
* `NE` or `<>` or `!` 
* `LT` or `<`
* `LE` or `<=`
* `GT` or `>`
* `GE` or `>=`
